# DISCORD BOT üëæ

I developed this discord bot to learn how to build one and during the building journey I learned a lot about discord bots. I built this bot using node.js and faced multiple bugs while developing this bot, but I overcame those bugs on my own.

## NOTE üìù
This bot is not hosted anywhere, so you can't add it to your server. But you can clone this repository customise your own bot and host it on your own for your own servers.
